Over-the-counter medications like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil) can help reduce fever and alleviate discomfort, but they should not be given to children without consulting a healthcare provider. If your fever is very high, lasts for more than a few days, or is accompanied by other symptoms such as severe headache, stiff neck, confusion, or difficulty breathing, seek medical attention immediately, as these could be signs of a serious infection. However, please note that while fever is a common symptom of many illnesses, it is not a disease itself, and its underlying cause should be diagnosed and treated by a healthcare professional.\n",

      "AI Response: I'm an AI and cannot prescribe medication, but I can provide information. For fever management, over-the-counter options include acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil). However, aspirin should not be given to children or adolescents due to the risk of Reye's syndrome. It's important to consult a healthcare professional for appropriate dosage and to ensure the fever is not a symptom of a more serious condition. Cool baths can also help alleviate high fevers. Remember, fevers are often the body's way of fighting infection, so they may not always need to be treated.\n"
